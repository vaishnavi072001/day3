              one code string. In cascading style sheet, we can make a duplicate copy of several website pages.If we
              make a webpage, it has the same formatting, looks, and feel, so with the help of the CSS rule for one
              page, and it is sufficient for all the pages.

              change the one-page format it will automatically apply to the other pages of CSS.

              automatically update the other CSS style sheet.

              responsive and user-friendly. CSS is used with Html to make webpage design responsive.</p>
