    <h1>JSS INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages.
        JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
    </p><h3>Features of JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</p>
    <p>Functions in JS are objects.They may have properties and methods just like other objects. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.</p>
    <p>Can handle date and time.</p>
    <p> Performs form validation although the forms are created using HTML.</p>
    <p>No compiler is needed.</p>
          
    <p><h3>Applications of JavaScript</h3></p>   
    <p>Web Development: Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
    </p>
    <p>Server Applications: With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and Node.js is the most powerful on the server side.
    </p>
    <p>Mobile Applications: JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere

    <p><h3>Javascript Data Types</h3></p>
    <p>JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <pre><h3>1.Primitive data type:</h3>
The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.</pre>
     <p>The different types of primitive datatypes are:</p>
     <p>a.String:	represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"</p>
     <p>b.Number:	represents numeric values e.g. 100</p>
     <p>c.Boolean:	represents boolean value either false or true</p>
     <p>d.Undefined:	represents undefined value</p>
     <p>e.Null:	represents null i.e. no value at all</p>
    <pre><h3>2.Non-primitive data type:</h3>
The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.</pre>
    <p>The different types of non-primitive datatypes are:</p>
    <p>Object:represents instance through which we can access members</p>
    <p>Array:	represents group of similar values</p>
    <p>RegExp:represents regular expression</p>
    <p><h2>Advantages of Javascript:</h2></p>
    <p>Easy to use: It is not difficult to start working in JavaScript. For this reason, many of us prefer to start our adventure in the IT sector by learning this language. It gives the power to make rich interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>Saves time and bandwidth: Regardless of where you host JavaScript, it always gets executed on the client environment to save lots of bandwidth and make the execution process fast.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Environment Support: JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and may be utilized in an enormous sort of application.</p>
    <p>Open source: Many open-source projects provide useful help for developers to add JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Programming language: There are many available courses within the field of JavaScript, because of which youâ€™ll quickly and simply expand your knowledge of this programming language.</p>
