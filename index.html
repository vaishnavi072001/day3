    <h1>HTML INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.This
        language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is
        human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>HTML Elements And Tags</h2>
    </p>
    <P> HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets <> and typically come in pairs, i.e. an opening tag and a closing tag.
            The closing tag has same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character.
    </P>
    <p>Types of HTML Tags</p>

    <p>
    <h3>1.Paragraph Tag<P>
    </h3>
    </p>
    <p>The HTML element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add
        some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>2.Heading Tag<P>
    </h3>
    </p>
    <p>HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.</p>

    <h3>3.Image Tag</h3>
    </p>
    <p>The image tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page;
        images are linked to web pages. The image tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
        The image tag has two required attributes:
        <br>
        src - Specifies the path to the image.
        <br>
        alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Features</h2>
    </p>
    <p> User Friendly & Simple:
    <p>You can write HTML using annotations called tags. Tags give HTML a structure and make it easy for humans and
        browsers to read the document efficiently. They also enable a browser to apply CSS (Cascaded StyleSheets) to the
        digital document, making it a powerful visual combination.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Adaptability:</p>
    <p>People with practically any form of handicap, such as vision impairment, color blindness, poor vision, blindness,
        and so on, may use websites built using HTML5â€™s accessibility capabilities.
